# Eros and Psyche
This project is an effort to make a solid, open edition of Apuleius' famous
allegory of the descent of the soul, in English with commentary, having the
goal of providing an introduction to Neoplatonism.

## Illustrations
The illustrations are by Friedrich Paul Thumann (1834–1908). I have taken the
illustrations from several books:

1.  Hamerling, Robert. *Amor und Psyche: eine Dichtung in sechs Gesängen.*
    Adolf Titze, Leipzig, 1882.

2.  Carus, Paul. *Eros and Psyche: a Fairy-tale of Ancient Greece, Retold After
    Apuleius.* Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago, 1900.
